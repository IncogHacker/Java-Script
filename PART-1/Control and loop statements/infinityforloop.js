///ANother way to write infinity loop


//* use case: Game Development:
//? In game development, an infinite loop can be used to continuously update and render game frames until a specific condition (e.g., game over) is met.

for(;;)
{
    console.log("1");
    //update games logic and render frames like FPS(frame rate per second comes from here coz we see our frames every time coz of infinity loops)
}

//? Reduce method
// The reduce method in JavaScript is used to accumulate or reduce an array to a single value. It iterates over the elements of an array and applies a callback function to each element, updating an accumulator value with the result. The reduce method takes a callback function as its first argument and an optional initial value for the accumulator as the second argument.


// syntax

//!      array.reduce(function callback(accumulator, currentValue, index, array) {
   //!             Return the updated accumulator value
// !                               }, initialValue);


// callback: A function that is called once for each element in the array.

// accumulator: The accumulated result of the previous iterations.

// currentValue: The current element being processed in the array.

// index (optional): The index of the current element being processed.

// array (optional): The array reduce was called upon.

// initialValue (optional): An initial value for the accumulator. If not provided, the first element of the array is used as the initial accumulator value.
